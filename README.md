# ILR_depth_all

The MATLAB files to implement the ILR depth

PP_generating.m: Simulate a sample of Poisson point processes with a certain intensity function. 

ILR_depth.m: Compute the ILR depth for a given sample. 

TopDepVisual.m: Show the plot of point process realizations with top/bottom depth values. 

add_drop_event.m: Make each process realization in a Poisson process sample with the same cardinality. 

ternaryPlotSimple.m: Make ternary plot to show the point processes with cardinality 2 and the corresponding depth contour. 

plotEuclidean.m: Plot the point processes with cardinality 2 in Euclidean space and the corresponding depth contour. 

main_hpp_contour.m: Implementation of Figure 2(a), 2(b) of the paper.

main_hpp_show.m: Implementation of Figure 3(a), 3(b) of the paper.

main_ipp_contour.m: Implementation of a Figure K.9(a), K.9(b) of the paper.

main_ipp_show.m: Implementation of a Figure K.10(a), K.10(b) of the paper.
